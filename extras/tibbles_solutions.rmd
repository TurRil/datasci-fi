# `Tibble` Exercises

```{r}
library(tibble)
```

## Exercise 1

```{r}
# load the data
data(mtcars)

is(mtcars)  # the type is data.frame

mtcars %>% as_tibble()
```

## Exercise 2

## Exercise 2.1

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

annoying <- tibble(
  `1` = 1:10,
  `2` = `1` * 2 + rnorm(length(`1`))
)

ggplot(data = annoying) +
  geom_point(aes(x = `1`, y = `2`))
```

## Exercise 2.2

```{r}
annoying$`3` <- annoying$`2` / annoying$`1`
annoying
```

## Exercise 2.4

Has to be done before the renaming.

```{r}
annoying$`1`
annoying
```

## Exercise 2.3

```{r}
colnames(annoying) <- c("one", "two", "three")
annoying
```

## Exercise 3

It is like a named vector that is converted into a data_frame/tibble. We might use it before we use `mutate`.

```{r}
v <- 1:10
names(v) <- letters[v]

d <- enframe(v)
d
```

## Exercise 4

In the example below `tibble.max_extra_cols` is set to `100` and defines how many additional column names are printed

```{r}
options(tibble.max_extra_cols = 100)
```
